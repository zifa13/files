			###Steps to configure apache REVERSE PROXY with source code###

#step 1
	download the apache tar file (source code)
	  
	  httpd-2.4.51.tar.gz 

copy this file to the linux via win scp
now for win scp always remember you need to have the root access/permisssion

#step 2
after copying this file to the linux go the directory "/"
take the back up of the file 
	mv ~centos/httpd-2.4.51.tar.gz ./httpd-2.4.51.tar.gz.bak

#step3
and make directories over there 
	mkdir /rp /qpp1 /app2 /app3

#step4
copy that zip file into these directories one by one		
		
	cp ~centos/httpd-2.4.51.tar.gz /rp/
    cp ~centos/httpd-2.4.51.tar.gz /app1/
    cp ~centos/httpd-2.4.51.tar.gz /app2/
    cp ~centos/httpd-2.4.51.tar.gz /app3/

#step 5
now go to one of the directory /app3
 extract and unzip the file with this below command
	tar -xvzf httpd-2.4.51.tar.gz
#step 6
now go the directory 
	cd httpd-2.4.51
	
#step 7 : Prerequisites	

Some prerequisites are required like

	a) Packages "apr and apr-util" 
		sudo yum install -y apr apr-util

	b) "gcc" 
		sudo yum install -y gcc

	c) "pcre" 
		sudo yum install pcre-devel -y

	d) Disk space need to be free atleast(50Mb)
		free -h

where , PCRE - Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions Library

always remember 
need to get extract the httpd zip file two times with different name like 
	Rename 1st extracted file to avoid confusion
		mv httpd-2.4.51 httpd1-2.4.51

then extract it again with command 
		httpd-2.4.51.tar.gz


run this command in 
	cd httpd1-2.4.51
	./configure --prefix=/app3/inst1/apache
	make
	make install
	vim /app3/inst1/apache/conf/httpd.conf
 change the port for app 3 instance 1 - 83
 
Start the service for instance 1
	/app3/inst1/apache/bin/apachectl -k start

now for instance 2 
	cd httpd-2.4.51
 
	./configure --prefix=/app3/inst2/apache
	make
	make install
	vim /app3/inst2/apache/conf/httpd.conf
 change the port for app 3 instance 2 - 84
 
 Start the service for instance 2
	/app3/inst2/apache/bin/apachectl -k start
 
	Follow the same for app1 and app2
	
Now use this command to check 
		curl http://localhost:88
		curl http://localhost:89
		
#### REVERSE PROXY ####

copy zip file into /rp 
then extract it here only
		tar -xvzf httpd-2.4.51.tar.gz
Go to with 
		cd httpd-2.4.51

cinfigure the path now with command
		./configure --prefix=/rp/apache

now compile it with make command and install those packages and make directory
		make
		make install
		
		 vim /rp/apache/conf/httpd.conf

                 </location>
                 </VirtualHost>

Add the following modules
		LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
		LoadModule proxy_http_module modules/mod_proxy_http.so
		LoadModule slotmem_shm_module modules/mod_slotmem_shm.so
		
save file and exit

Now start the service 
		/rp/apache/bin/apachectl -k start

for better understanding go to every apps htdocs and change the index.html file with name like for example

		 	vim /app1/inst1/apache/htdocs/index.html
			vim /app1/inst2/apache/htdocs/index.html

now go to browser or use curl for testing
		
	curl http://localhost/app1/inst1
	curl http://localhost/app1/inst2
	curl http://localhost/app2/inst1
	curl http://localhost/app2/inst2
	curl http://localhost/app3/inst1
	curl http://localhost/app3/inst2
