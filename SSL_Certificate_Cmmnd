# Create CSR using the private key
req -new -key ca.key -subj "/CN=xdi.cloud" -out ca.csr

openssl  req -new -key ca.key -subj "/C=US/ST=CO/O=XD Innovation/OU=IT/CN=training.minutuscomputing.com/emailAddress=zifa.khan@minutuscomputing.com" -out ca.csr

# Self signed certificate using its own private key
x509 -req -in ca.csr -signkey ca.key -CAcreateserial  -out ca.crt -days 1000

## Create private key and certificate signing request

req -out 3dxserver.csr -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout 3dxserver.key -subj "/C=US/ST=CO/O=XD Innovation/OU=IT/CN=training.minutuscomputing.com/emailAddress=zifa.khan@minutuscomputing.com"

x509 -req -in 3dxserver.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out 3dxserver.crt -days 1000

To read the certificate run this commands
